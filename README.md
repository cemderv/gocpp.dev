# Go C++, your quickstart to C++ projects

With a single command, Go C++ sets up:

- A CMake-based C++ project
- Package management using CPM
- Formatting using clang-format
- Compile-time checks using Cppcheck and clang-tidy
- Code-hardening flags enabled, as recommended by the OpenSSF
- Flags that enable runtime memory error detection using AddressSanitizer

Please visit [https://gocpp.dev](https://gocpp.dev) to create a project.

This repository only hosts the script file that is used to generate projects,
and serves as an issue tracker.
